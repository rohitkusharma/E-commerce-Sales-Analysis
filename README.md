## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the "Sample - Superstore" dataset to identify key trends and insights regarding sales, profitability, and customer behavior. This analysis aims to answer business questions to support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **[Sample - Superstore Dataset]([url](https://github.com/rohitkusharma/E-commerce-Sales-Analysis/blob/0140a8aa7033cc4a59e30df8d93e8321438a305e/Sample%20-%20Superstore.csv))** from Kaggle. It contains sales data for a US-based superstore.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas (for data manipulation), Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- **Environment:** Google Colab

## Analysis Process
1.  **Data Loading:** Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Corrected the data types for date columns to enable time-series analysis. Verified that there were no missing values or duplicates.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed analysis to answer the following key questions:
    * What are the best-selling and most profitable product categories?
    * Which customer segment is the most important?
    * How do sales trend over time?

## Key Findings & Visualizations

* **Profitability by Category:** The Technology category is the most profitable, while the Furniture category has a significantly lower profit margin compared to others.
* **Customer Segmentation:** The 'Consumer' segment is the largest contributor to both sales and profit, making it the most valuable customer segment.
* **Sales Trend:** The analysis of monthly sales shows a clear upward trend over the years and indicates seasonality, with sales consistently peaking at the end of the year.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the superstore's sales and profitability. The findings suggest a need to investigate the low profitability of the Furniture category and to continue focusing marketing efforts on the high-value Consumer segment.
